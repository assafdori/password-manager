## Password Manager üîê 

**Objective:** Deploy a secure, self-hosted password manager application in a Kubernetes cluster using GitOps principles.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Docker:** Containerize the password manager application.
- **Terraform:** Provision the required infrastructure, including Kubernetes cluster, networking, and any necessary IAM roles.
- **Kubernetes:** Deploy the password manager as a service within the cluster.
- **ArgoCD:** Implement GitOps for continuous deployment and management of the application.

## Current Tasks
- [x] ~~Select a Password Manager~~
- [ ] Provision Infrastructure (Terraform)
- [ ] Kubernetes Deployment
- [ ] Implement GitOps with ArgoCD
- [ ] Secure the Deployment
- [ ] Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] Document the Project

## Step-by-Step Plan

### 1. Select a Password Manager
- Choose an open-source password manager that supports containerization, like Bitwarden or Vaultwarden (a lightweight Bitwarden fork).

### 2. Containerize the Application (Docker)
- If not already available, create a Dockerfile for the password manager application.
- Ensure the Dockerfile is optimized for security and performance.
- Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).

### 3. Provision Infrastructure (Terraform)
- Create Terraform scripts to provision the necessary infrastructure on your cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
  - **VPC**: Create a secure VPC with appropriate subnets.
  - **Kubernetes Cluster**: Use managed services like EKS (AWS), GKE (GCP), or AKS (Azure) or set up a self-managed cluster using k3s.
  - **IAM Roles**: Set up IAM roles and policies for secure access, following the principle of least privilege.
  - **Storage**: Provision persistent storage (e.g., EBS volumes on AWS) for the password manager's data.

### 4. Kubernetes Deployment
- Write Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) for the deployment, service, ingress, and persistent volume claims (PVCs) for the password manager.
- Configure secrets management (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets) to handle sensitive data like database credentials or encryption keys.

### 5. Implement GitOps with ArgoCD
- Set up ArgoCD in your Kubernetes cluster.
- Connect ArgoCD to your Git repository where the Kubernetes manifests are stored.
- Configure ArgoCD to continuously monitor the repository and automatically apply changes to the cluster.
- Use ArgoCD's application CRDs to define how the password manager should be deployed and managed.

### 6. Secure the Deployment
- Use SSL/TLS for secure communication (e.g., Cert-Manager for automatic certificate management).
- Ensure that the application is only accessible via HTTPS.
- Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to restrict access to the Kubernetes resources.

### 7. Monitoring and Logging
- Deploy monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the application and infrastructure.
- Set up logging with tools like Fluentd and Elasticsearch to capture and analyze logs.

### 8. Document the Project
- Create thorough documentation for each step of the project, including how to set up the environment, deploy the application, and manage it using ArgoCD.
- Write a detailed README for your GitHub repository explaining the project, technologies used, and how to replicate it.

## Additional Enhancements
- **CI/CD Integration:** Implement a CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automate testing, building, and pushing Docker images.
- **Security Auditing:** Use tools like Trivy to scan your Docker images for vulnerabilities.
- **Backup and Restore:** Implement a backup strategy for the password manager's data.
